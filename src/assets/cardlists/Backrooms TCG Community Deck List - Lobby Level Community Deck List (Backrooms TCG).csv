You start with Painite Wall and Golden Stairs out of play.
Once you successfully pass through Punctured Wall using Shrink Drink you shuffle Painite Wall into your PP and noclip (by passing the Punctured Wall you successfully evaded all        entities as they cannot follow)
When you find Painite Wall and travel away, remove it from the game.
Travel back through a Punctured Wall (Shrink Drink) holding a Painite Gem: Shuffle Golden Stairs into your PP and noclip.
Now find the Stairs and Escape....

Easy Mode:
Start with Painite Wall out of play
Once you pass through Punctured Wall using Shrink Drink: noclip.
place Painite Wall on top of Punctured Wall, acquire the Gem and continue your search for the Stairs.

Hard Mode:
Based on Normal Mode, exchange Alia or Freeman for FA Partygoer (81/100)

Nightmare:
Replace as many Papersnakes as you like with Gamemasters and you'll definitely face your fears sooner or later (but maybe Blusher will be your friend in this scenario as it is the only card messing with your DIH... will your nightmare save you???)",,

Greener Pastures","You’ve just no-clipped into the Backrooms, a place commonly discarded as a myth. As you wander through corridor after dull yellow corridor, you see shambling bodies wearing hazmat suits. They all mumble about it being “…too late…” and that they want to go back to the “party”. When they notice you, their glazed eyes fill you with unease, and they start chasing you around the Backrooms as you try to find a way out. As you stumble over mysterious drink canisters and odd-looking tennis balls, you follow some moths and find a door that leads into an inviting, vivid field of flowers and grass. The warmth of the sun and the cool breeze of the wind fill you with a calm that you desperately need after what you’ve just experienced. You drift off to sleep…

Only to awaken back in the same halls you were just running from. You faintly hear the sound of laughter, accompanied by… inflating balloons? As you stand back up, you see discarded paper party hats and empty drink cups littered on the floor. Streamers line the walls with banners that are scratched out or marred in blood. Knocked over fold-up tables look like make-shift barricades with crumped up hazmat suits decorating the corners. The Backrooms aren’t done with you yet. It wants you to stick around for the festivities, possibly forever – but you are done with its tricks and rejected the RSVP. You will make it back home… or this might be the last party you’ll ever attend.

Premise & Setup
This two-deck game uses Greener Pastures as an “in-between” card, much like the Car Park and Aquazone Portal cards. This is to use the card in a different way before the new sets come out, or for those who want to prolong a visit to the Lobby Level.

Your objective is to escape from the Lost Agents that litter the first section of the Lobby and survive the mental onslaught of the Partygoers in the second to secure your escape. The first deck will prioritize escaping and evading Lost Agents using “party favors” to distract them or “fun party toys” to knock them out. The second deck will pit you against the Partygoers and a couple of their all-smiles friends who really, really want you to stick around for life. Thankfully there are a couple of friends who can help you out in sneaking past if you’re unprepared or pushing through the crowd to force your way through.",,

We’re going in as a Wanderer that is high strung and paranoid after stumbling into unknown, hostile territory. Plus, with Greener Pastures being used differently, we’ll  have to figure out how to use it.

When you begin the second deck (The Party), place Greener Pastures at the 6’o clock position and you start there. Deal as normal afterward. You do not lose any Sanity for using Greener Pastures, but instead keep your previous Sanity score. Greener Pastures then becomes a Permanent Fixture, but can have cards placed over it like a normal Room. Going back in will end the game in defeat as if it were The Void.This is to hopefully curb getting brain-sacked by Partygoers by not starting at half or less the max Sanity score. Going back to the dream of Greener Pastures will have you stay there, letting your body rot away in the Backrooms.

You cannot drink Almond Water. Using Almond Water to subdue a Lost Agent will grant you the Sanity score of using it normally.You wouldn’t just trust some random can on the floor of a strange place! But you notice that the poor souls here would reach for the cans first and ignore you…

You cannot eat Death Moth Jelly. Besides the normal Arch Raven interaction, gifting this to the Crimson Knight will motivate them to kill a Partygoer on the FOP. You lose the chance for a Panite Gem if you do this. Using the jelly this way grants you the Sanity score.If you wouldn’t drink from a random can, you wouldn’t eat from an unlabeled jar of goo either! But that big red fellow isn’t picky.
